  questStart: Well hello there, handsome. After the sand storm I seem to be a bit
    dried out. Could you please bring me something refreshing?
  wrongItem: Oh darling, this definitely won't do. I need something refreshing.
  okItem: Welcome back, beautiful. What's this? Hmm I can certainly try it, that's
    for sure. We'll see how refreshed I will feel.
  goodItem: Oh you are my saviour, pour it all over me.
  lostItem: I am so sorry, cutie, but that thing wasn't as refreshing as we hoped.
