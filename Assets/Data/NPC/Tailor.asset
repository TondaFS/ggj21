  questStart: Welcome to my garments store. Sadly ever since the storm I don't have
    any tools to cut fabrics with.
  wrongItem: Thank you, but I have to decline this offer. This object is not useful
    for cutting anything.
  okItem: Let me see. Hmm, this may be useful. I will try it and let you know how
    it went.
  goodItem: Oh yes, scissors are obviously best for cutting fabrics. Thank you. Now
    back to business.
  lostItem: Welcome back to my garment store. I tried that sharp thing you brought
    me and I have to say it didn't do the trick.
