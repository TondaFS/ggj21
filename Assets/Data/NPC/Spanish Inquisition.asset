  questStart: Our royal bottom will not sit on this firm chair. Our royal bottom
    needs heavenly softness.
  wrongItem: This doesn't look soft enough for our royal bottom.
  okItem: We shall try and put this between our royal bottom and this chair. But
    we doubt it will be soft enough.
  goodItem: Oh heavens. This is it. This is the exactly right. Our royal bottom will
    never feel sore ever again.
  lostItem: We tried to sit on that thing you brought us. It wasn't soft enough for
    our royal bottom.
