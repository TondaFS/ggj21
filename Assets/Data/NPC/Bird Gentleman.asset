  questStart: Would you be so kind and help a troubled gentleman? I miss having the
    addictive smoke in my lungs.
  wrongItem: Pardon me, but this thing is neither addictive nor would deliver the
    smoke to my lungs.
  okItem: I suppose that this could help me start the process, but I need something
    else as well.

    Now I can finally throw my vape away.
  lostItem: I need some kind of smoke delivering vessel.
